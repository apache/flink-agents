## Overview
Flink Agents is an Agentic AI framework based on Apache Flink. By integrate agent with flink DataStream/Table, Flink Agents can leverage the powerful data processing ability of Flink. 
## From/To Flink DataStream API

First of all, get the flink `StreamExecutionEnvironment` and flink-agents `AgentsExecutionEnvironment`.

```python
# Set up the Flink streaming environment and the Agents execution environment.
env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
agents_env = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment(env)
```

Integrate the agent with input `DataStream`, and return the output `DataStream` can be consumed by downstream.

```python
# create input datastream
input_stream = env.from_source(...)

# integrate agent with input datastream, and return output datastream
output_stream = (
    agents_env.from_datastream(
        input=input_stream, key_selector=lambda x: x.id
    )
    .apply(your_agent)
    .to_datastream()
)

# comsume agent output datastream
output_stream.print()
```

The input `DataStream` must be `KeyedStream`, or user should provide `KeySelector` to tell how to convert the input `DataStream` to `KeyedStream`.

## From/To Flink Table API

First of all, get the flink `StreamExecutionEnvironment`, `StreamTableEnvironment`, and flink-agents `AgentsExecutionEnvironment`.
```python
# Set up the Flink streaming environment and table environment
env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
t_env = StreamTableEnvironment.create(stream_execution_environment=env)

# Setup flink agnets execution environment
agents_env = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment(env=env, t_env=t_env)
```

Integrate the agent with input `Table`, and return the output `Table` can be consumed by downstream.

```python
output_type = ExternalTypeInfo(RowTypeInfo(
    [BasicTypeInfo.INT_TYPE_INFO()],
    ["result"],
))

schema = (Schema.new_builder().column("result", DataTypes.INT())).build()

output_table = (
    agents_env.from_table(input=input_table, key_selector=MyKeySelector())
    .apply(agent)
    .to_table(schema=schema, output_type=output_type)
)
```

User should provide `KeySelector` in `from_table()` to tell how to convert the input `Table` to `KeyedStream` internally. And provide `Schema` and `TypeInfomation` in `to_table()` to tell the output `Table` schema.

__Note:__ Currently, user should provide both `Schema` and `TypeInformation` when call `to_table()`, we will support only provide one of them in the future.
