## Overview

ReAct Agent is a general paradigm that combines reasoning and action capabilities to solve complex tasks. Leveraging this paradigm, the user only needs to specify the goal with prompt and provide available tools, and the LLM will decide how to achieve the goal and take actions autonomously

## ReAct Agent Example

```python
my_react_agent = ReActAgent(
    chat_model=chat_model_descriptor,
    prompt=my_prompt,
    output_schema=MyBaseModelDataType, # or output_schema=my_row_type_info
)
```
## Initialize Arguments
### Chat Model
User should specify the chat model used in the ReAct Agent.

We use `ResourceDescriptor` to describe the chat model, includes chat model type and chat model arguments. See [Chat Model]({{< ref "docs/development/chat_models" >}}) for more details.
```python
chat_model_descriptor = ResourceDescriptor(
    clazz=OllamaChatModelSetup,
    connection="my_ollama_connection",
    model="qwen3:8b",
    tools=["my_tool1, my_tool2"],
)
```

### Prompt
User can provide prompt to instruct agent. 

The prompt should contain two messages. The first message tells the agent what to do, and gives the input and output example. The second message tells how to convert input element to text string.
```python
system_prompt_str = """
    Analyze 
    ...
    
    Example input format: 
    ...
    
    Ensure your response can be parsed by Python JSON, using this format as an example:
    ...
    """
    
# Prompt for review analysis react agent.
my_prompt = Prompt.from_messages(
    messages=[
        ChatMessage(
            role=MessageRole.SYSTEM,
            content=system_prompt_str,
        ),
        # For react agent, if the input element is not primitive types,
        # framework will deserialize input element to dict and fill the prompt.
        # Note, the input element should be primitive types, BaseModel or Row.
        ChatMessage(
            role=MessageRole.USER,
            content="""
            "id": {id},
            "review": {review}
            """,
        ),
    ],
) 

```
If the input element is primitive types, like `int`, `str` and so on, the second message should be
```python
ChatMessage(
    role=MessageRole.USER,
    content="{input}"
)
```

See [Prompt]({{< ref "docs/development/prompts" >}}) for more details.

### Output Schema
User can set output schema to configure the ReAct Agent output type. If output schema is set, the ReAct Agent will deserialize the llm response to expected type. 

The output schema should be `BaseModel` or `RowTypeInfo`.
```python
class MyBaseModelDataType(BaseModel):
    id: str
    score: int
    reasons: list[str]

# Currently, for RowTypeInfo, only support BasicType fields.
my_row_type_info = RowTypeInfo(
        [BasicTypeInfo.STRING_TYPE_INFO(), BasicTypeInfo.INT_TYPE_INFO()],
        ["id", "score"],
    )
```
