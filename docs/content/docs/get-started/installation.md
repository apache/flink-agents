## Overview
Flink Agents provides both Python and Java APIs to define a Flink Agents job.

The sections below show how to install the required dependencies.

{{< hint warning >}}
__NOTE:__ To run on flink cluster, Flink-Agents requires flink version be a stable release of Flink 1.20.3.
{{< /hint >}}

## Install Apache Flink

Before installing Flink Agents, you need to have Apache Flink 1.20.3 installed.

Download and extract Flink 1.20.3:

```shell
# Download Flink 1.20.3: https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/flink/flink-1.20.3/flink-1.20.3-bin-scala_2.12.tgz
curl -LO https://archive.apache.org/dist/flink/flink-1.20.3/flink-1.20.3-bin-scala_2.12.tgz

# Extract the archive
tar -xzf flink-1.20.3-bin-scala_2.12.tgz

# Set FLINK_HOME environment variable
export FLINK_HOME=$(pwd)/flink-1.20.3

# Copy the flink-python JAR from opt to lib (required for PyFlink)
cp $FLINK_HOME/opt/flink-python-1.20.3.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

{{< hint info >}}
**Note:** For more detailed Flink installation instructions, refer to the [Flink local installation guide](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/try-flink/local_installation/).
{{< /hint >}}

## Install Flink Agents

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or 3.11
* For building from source, you also need:
  - Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, or WSL)
  - Git
  - Maven 3
  - Java 11

### Set Up Python Environment (Recommended)

We recommend using a Python virtual environment to isolate Flink Agents dependencies from your system Python packages.

**Create a virtual environment:**

Using `venv` (built-in with Python 3):
```shell
# Create a virtual environment in a directory named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

{{< hint info >}}
**Note:** If `python3` command is not found, try `python` instead. Some systems alias `python` to Python 3.
{{< /hint >}}

**To deactivate when you're done:**
```shell
deactivate
```

### Install Flink Agents Package

Choose one of the following installation methods:

#### From Official Release

{{< hint warning >}}
__Note:__ This will be available after Flink Agents is released.
{{< /hint >}}

Install Flink Agents using pip:

```shell
pip install flink-agents
```

#### From Source

**Clone the repository:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-agents.git
cd flink-agents
```

**Build and install:**

Run the build script to build both Java and Python components:

```shell
./tools/build.sh
```

This script will:
- Build all Java modules using Maven
- Build the Python package
- Install the Python package into your current Python environment
- Package the distribution JAR with all dependencies

{{< hint info >}}
**Note:** If you activated a virtual environment earlier, the Python package will be installed into that virtual environment. Otherwise, it will be installed into your system Python environment.
{{< /hint >}}

After building:
- The Python package is installed and ready to use
- The distribution JAR is located at: `dist/target/flink-agents-dist-*.jar`


## Deploy to Flink Cluster

After installing Flink Agents package, you need to deploy it to your Flink cluster so that Flink can run your agent jobs.

### Configure PYTHONPATH

Flink runs in its own JVM process and needs the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to locate the flink-agents Python package. You need to set `PYTHONPATH` to the directory where flink-agents is installed.

**Determine your Python package installation path:**

The path depends on your Python environment setup:
- If using a virtual environment, it's the site-packages directory within your venv
- If using system Python, it's the system site-packages directory

**Tip:** You can use this command to help find the path:
```shell
python3 -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])'
```

**Set PYTHONPATH before starting Flink:**

```shell
# Set PYTHONPATH to your Python site-packages directory

export PYTHONPATH=$(python -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])')
```

{{< hint info >}}
**Note:** You can add the `export PYTHONPATH=...` line to your shell profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zprofile`, or `~/.zshrc`) to set it permanently. This way, it will be automatically configured in all future terminal sessions.
{{< /hint >}}

### Install Flink Agents Java Library

Copy the Flink Agents distribution JAR to your Flink installation's `lib` directory:

{{< tabs "Install Flink Agents Java Library" >}}

{{< tab "From Official Release" >}}
The Flink Agents JAR is bundled inside the Python package. Use the PYTHONPATH you configured above to locate and copy it:

```shell
# Copy the JAR from the Python package to Flink's lib directory
cp $PYTHONPATH/flink_agents/lib/flink-agents-dist-*.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "From Source" >}}
After building from source, the distribution JAR is located in the `dist/target/` directory:

```shell
# Copy the JAR to Flink's lib directory
cp dist/target/flink-agents-dist-*.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### Start Flink Cluster or Submit Job

Once the Java library is installed and PYTHONPATH is configured, you can start your Flink cluster or submit jobs:

```shell
# Start your Flink cluster
$FLINK_HOME/bin/start-cluster.sh

# Or submit your job directly
$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run -py /path/to/your/job.py
```

See [deployment]({{< ref "docs/operations/deployment" >}}) for more details on running Flink Agents jobs.
