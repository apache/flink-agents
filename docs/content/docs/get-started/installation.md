# Installation

Flink Agents provides both Python and Java APIs to define a Flink Agents job.

To try Flink Agents in Python on a local executor, you only need to install the Flink Agents Python package.

To define a Flink Agents job using the Java API, or to run the job in a Flink cluster, you need to install both the Flink Agents Python and Java dependencies. 

The sections below show how to install the required dependencies.

## Install from PyPI

{{< hint warning >}}
__Note:__ This will be available after Flink Agents is released.
{{< /hint >}}

To install the latest Flink Agents release, run:

```shell
python -m pip install flink-agents
```

<!-- TODO: link to local quickstart example docs -->
Now you can run a Flink Agents job on the local executor.
See [local quickstart example]() for end-to-end examples of running on the local executor.


To run on a Flink cluster, ensure the Flink Agents Java JARs are placed in the Flink lib directory:

<!-- TODO: fill in the command after Flink Agents is released -->
```shell
# Download the Flink Agents released flink-agents-dist jar.

# After downloading the bundle jar, copy it to Flink's lib directory.
cp flink-agents-dist-$VERSION.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

<!-- TODO: link to flink quickstart example docs -->
See [Flink quickstart example]() for end-to-end examples of running on Flink.


## Build and Install from Source

Prerequisites for building Flink Agents:

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
* Git
* Maven
* Java 11
* Python 3.10 or 3.11

To clone from Git, run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-agents.git
```

### Build
To run on a Flink cluster, we need build the whole project.

We provide a script to run:

```shell
bash tools/build.sh
```

### Java Build

To try Flink Agents in Java, user can build java independently.

```shell
cd flink-agents
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### Python Build and Install

To try Flink Agents in Python on a local executor,
user can build Python independently.

{{< tab "uv (Recommended)" >}}

uv is a modern, fast Python package manager that offers significant performance 
improvements over pip. 

If uv is not installed already, you can install it with the following command:

```shell
pip install uv
```
Please see [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) for more detail.

```shell
cd python

# Build sdist and wheel into python/dist/
uv run python -m build

# Install the built wheel into the environment
uv pip install dist/*.whl
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "pip" >}}

We also support building and installing with pip

```shell
cd python

# Build sdist and wheel into python/dist/
python -m build

# Install the built wheel into the environment
python -m pip install dist/*.whl
```

### Install Flink Agents to Flink


To install the Java dependencies to Flink, run:

```shell

# copy the Flink Agents JARs to Flink's lib directory
cp flink-agents-dist-$VERSION.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```
