## What is Flink Agents?

**Apache Flink Agents** is a brand-new sub-project from the Apache Flink community, providing an **open-source framework for building event-driven streaming agents**.

Building on Flink's battle-tested streaming engine, Apache Flink Agents inherits **distributed, at-scale, fault-tolerant structured data processing and mature state management**, and adds first-class abstractions for Agentic AI building blocks and functionalities - **large language models (LLMs)**, **prompts**, **tools**, **memory**, **dynamic orchestration**, **observability**, and more.

## Features

The key features of Apache Flink Agents include:
- **Massive Scale and Millisecond Latency**: Processes massive-scale event streams in real time, leveraging Flink's distributed processing engine.
- **Seamless Data and AI Integration**: Agents interact directly with Flink's DataStream and Table APIs for input and output, enabling a smooth integration of structured data processing and semantic AI capabilities within Flink.
- **Exactly-Once Action Consistency**: Ensures exactly-once consistency for agent actions and their side effects by integrating Flink's checkpointing with an external write-ahead log.
- **Familiar Agent Abstractions**: Leverages well-known AI agent concepts, making it easy for developers experienced with agent-based systems to quickly adopt and build on Apache Flink Agents without a steep learning curve.
- **Multi-Language Supports**: Provides native APIs in both Python and Java, enabling seamless integration into diverse development environments and allowing teams to use their preferred programming language.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Natively integrates mainstream LLMs, vector stores from diverse providers, and tools or prompts hosted on MCP servers into your agents, while enabling customizable extensions.
- **Observability**: Adopts an event-centric orchestration approach, where all agent actions are connected and controlled by events, enabling observation and understanding of agent behavior through the event log.

## Getting Started

To get started with Apache Flink Agents, you can checkout the following quickstarts:

- [Workflow Agent Quickstart]({{< ref "docs/get-started/quickstart/workflow_agent" >}})
