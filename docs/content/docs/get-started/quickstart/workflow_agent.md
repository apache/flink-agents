## Overview

{{< hint warning >}}
**TODO**: Briefly describe what is workflow agent, what is can do, and when to use it.
{{< /hint >}}

This quickstart introduces two small, progressive streaming examples that demonstrate how to build LLM-powered workflows with Flink Agents:

- **Review Analysis**: Processes a stream of product reviews and uses a single agent to extract a rating (1â€“5) and unsatisfied reasons from each review.

- **Product Improvement Suggestions**: Builds on the first example by aggregating per-review analysis in windows to produce product-level summaries (score distribution and common complaints), then applies a second agent to generate concrete improvement suggestions for each product.

Together, these examples show how to build a multi-agent workflow with Flink Agents and run it on a Flink standalone cluster.

**TODO**: Add the example code here. And briefly explain the code.

## Prerequisites

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
* Git
* Java 11
* Python 3.10 or 3.11

## Preparation

### Prepare Flink

Download a stable release of Flink 1.20.3, then extract the archive:

```bash
curl -LO https://archive.apache.org/dist/flink/flink-1.20.3/flink-1.20.3-bin-scala_2.12.tgz
tar -xzf flink-1.20.3-bin-scala_2.12.tgz

# Copy the flink-python jar from opt to lib
cp ./flink-1.20.3/opt/flink-python-1.20.3.jar ./flink-1.20.3/lib
```
You can refer to the [local installation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/try-flink/local_installation/) instructions for more detailed step.


### Prepare Flink Agents

We recommand creating a Python virtual environment to install the Flink Agents Python library.

Follow the {{< ref "docs/get-started/installation" >}} instructions to install the Flink Agents Python and Java libraries.

### Prepare Ollama

Download and install Ollama from the official [website](https://ollama.com/download).

Then pull the qwen3:8b model, which is required by the quickstart examples

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:8b
```

### Deploy a Standalone Flink Cluster

You can deploy a standalone Flink cluster in your local environment with the following command.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(python -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])')
./flink-1.20.3/bin/start-cluster.sh
```

You should be able to navigate to the web UI at [localhost:8081](localhost:8081) to view the Flink dashboard and see that the cluster is up and running.

## Submit Flink Agents Job to Standalone Flink Cluster

### Clone the Flink Agents repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-agents.git
```

### Submit to Flink Cluster
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(python -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])')

# Run review analysis example
./flink-1.20.3/bin/flink run -py ./flink-agents/python/flink_agents/examples/quickstart/workflow_single_agent_example.py

# Run product suggestion example
./flink-1.20.3/bin/flink run -py ./flink-agents/python/flink_agents/examples/quickstart/workflow_multiple_agent_example.py
```

Now you should see a Flink job submitted to the Flink Cluster in Flink web UI [localhost:8081](localhost:8081)

After a few minutes, you can check for the output in the TaskManager output log.
