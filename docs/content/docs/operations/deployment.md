## Overview

We provide two options to run the job:

- **Run without Flink**
    - **Language Support**: Only Python
    - **Input and Output**: Python List
    - **Suitable Use Case**: Local Testing and Debugging

- **Run in Flink**
    - **Language Support**: Python & Java
    - **Input and Output**: DataStream or Table
    - **Suitable Use Case**: Production

These deployment modes differ in supported languages and data formats, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your use case.

## Run without Flink

After completing the [installation of flink-agents]({{< ref "docs/get-started/installation" >}}) and building your [ReAct Agent]({{< ref "docs/development/react_agent" >}}) or [workflow agent]({{< ref "docs/development/workflow_agent" >}}), you can test and execute your agent locally using a simple Python script. This allows you to validate logic without requiring a Flink cluster.

### Example for Local Run with Test Data

```python
from flink_agents.api.execution_environment import AgentsExecutionEnvironment
from my_module.agents import MyAgent  # Replace with your actual agent path

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 1. Initialize environment
    env = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
    
    # 2. Prepare test data
    input_data = [
        {"key": "0001", "value": "Calculate the sum of 1 and 2."},
        {"key": "0002", "value": "Tell me a joke about cats."}
    ]
    
    # 3. Create agent instance
    agent = MyAgent()
    
    # 4. Build pipeline
    output_data = env.from_list(input_data) \
                     .apply(agent) \
                     .to_list()
    
    # 5. Execute and show results
    env.execute()
    
    print("\nExecution Results:")
    for record in output_data:
        for key, value in record.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")

```

#### Input Data Format

The input data should be a list of dictionaries `List[Dict[str, Any]]` with the following structure:

```python
[
    {
        # Optional field: Input key. 
        # The key is randomly generated if not provided.
        "key": "key_1",
        
        # Required field: Input content
        # This becomes the `input` field in InputEvent
        "value": "Calculate the sum of 1 and 2.",
    },
    ...
]
```

#### Output Data Format

The output data is a list of dictionaries `List[Dict[str, Any]]` where each dictionary contains a single key-value pair representing the processed result. The structure is generated from `OutputEvent` objects:

```python
[
    {key_1: output_1},  # From first OutputEvent
    {key_2: output_2},  # From second OutputEvent
    ...
]
```

## Run in Flink

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, Cygwin, or WSL)  
- **Python**: Version 3.10 or 3.11  
- **Flink**: A running Flink cluster with version 1.20.3 and the Flink Agents dependency installed

### Prepare Flink Agents

We recommand creating a Python virtual environment to install the Flink Agents Python library.

Follow the [instructions]({{< ref "docs/get-started/installation" >}}) to install the Flink Agents Python and Java libraries.

### Submit to Flink Cluster

{{< tabs "Submit to Flink Cluster" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
Submitting Flink Agent jobs to the Flink Cluster is the same as submitting PyFlink jobs. For more details on all available options, please refer to the [Flink CLI documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/cli/#submitting-pyflink-jobs).

```bash
<FLINK_HOME>/bin/flink run \
      --jobmanager <FLINK_CLUSTER_ADDR> \
      --python <PATH_TO_YOUR_FLINK_AGENTS_JOB>
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
Submitting Flink Agent jobs to the Flink Cluster is the same as submitting Flink jobs. For more details on all available options, please refer to the [Flink CLI documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/cli/#submitting-a-job).

```bash
<FLINK_HOME>/bin/flink run \
      -c <MAIN_CLASS> \
      <PATH_TO_YOUR_FLINK_AGENTS_JOB_JAR>
```
{{< hint warning >}}
Currently, to resolve the classloader issue, user should place the Flink Agents job jar to Flink lib directory before start the Flink cluster.

{{< /tabs >}}


Now you should see a Flink job submitted to the Flink Cluster in Flink web UI (typically accessible at http://&lt;jobmanagerHost&gt;:8081).
