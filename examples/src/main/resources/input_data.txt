No other shoe can compare to how the individual nubs on the bottom allow your foot to be cushioned, yet work like it's suppose to.

(Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).\n\nHighly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks.

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all."}

{"id": "B014IBJKNO", "review": "Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their \"Hurache's\"/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!"}

The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away."}

I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now."}

{"id": "B005AGO4LU", "review": "These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away."}

I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail.

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!"}

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!"}

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.\n\nMY STATS and other shoes:\nI road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.\nI LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms. They really give me support and flex needed. I have also used Asics and Puma."}

They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).\nIf you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.\nThe material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.\nNow these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.\nSolid choice, overall."}

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their \"Hurache's\"/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!"}

No other shoe can compare to how the individual nubs on the bottom allow your foot to be cushioned, yet work like it's suppose to.

(Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).\n\nHighly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks.

But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.\n\nMY STATS and other shoes:\nI road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.\nI LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms. They really give me support and flex needed. I have also used Asics and Puma."}

{"id": "B014IBJKNO", "review": "I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now."}
{"id": "B010RRWKT4", "review": "The picture makes the shoe look like it has a \"boxier\" toe rather than the \"pointier\" toe that it actually has. I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail. Otherwise, \"the shoe fits.\" So I am wearing it."}

{"id": "B005AGO4LU", "review": "I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now."}
{"id": "B009MA34NY", "review": "I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.\n\nMY STATS and other shoes:\nI road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.\nI LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms. They really give me support and flex needed. I have also used Asics and Puma."}

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all."}

I received many compliments the first time I wore them to the gym.  They are super soft and comfortable from the leg all the way to the waist...COMFORTABLE.  They never slip down at the waist and give me full coverage (not see through at all). I am 5' 4\" and 159 pounds and I ordered a medium.  The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo (probably my short legs) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf.  Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well.  They are also a nice stretchy fabric (thus the comfort) and cool.  We are in the high 90's and 100 degree summer weather and I am cool!  Purchase these as you won't be disappointed especially at this price.

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!"}

No other shoe can compare to how the individual nubs on the bottom allow your foot to be cushioned, yet work like it's suppose to. My feet feel cradled in this shoe and hard surfaces don't make my feet ache anymore.\n\nThese shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).\n\nHighly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks. As long as nike continues to make the flex supreme, they will get my money. Please don't change this shoe!"}

{"id": "B0092UF54A", "review": "Very good overall.\nNow Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.\nThese shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).\nIf you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.\nThe material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.\nNow these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.\nSolid choice, overall."}

Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars.

{"id": "B0058YEJ5K", "review": "These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away."}

I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail. Otherwise, \"the shoe fits.\" So I am wearing it."}
{"id": "B0014F7B98", "review": "I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now."}

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out.

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all."}

The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away."}

Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars.

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!"}

Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo).

(Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).\n\nHighly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks.

{"id": "B014IBJKNO", "review": "Very good overall.\nNow Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.\nThese shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).\nIf you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.\nThe material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.\nNow these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.\nSolid choice, overall."}
{"id": "B014IBJKNO", "review": "I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes."}

{"id": "B001IKJOLW", "review": "Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their \"Hurache's\"/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!"}

Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars.

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill.

I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner.

{"id": "B014IBJKNO", "review": "I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.\n\nI have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in.

I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now."}

{"id": "B0058YEJ5K", "review": "Great shoe. I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!"}

The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away."}

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill.

I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner.

I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).\nIf you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.\nThe material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.\nNow these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.\nSolid choice, overall."}

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes."}

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their \"Hurache's\"/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!"}

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.\n\nMY STATS and other shoes:\nI road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.\nI LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms. They really give me support and flex needed. I have also used Asics and Puma."}

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all."}

{"id": "B001IKJOLW", "review": "I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now."}

{"id": "B009MA34NY", "review": "I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes."}

{"id": "B005AGO4LU", "review": "Great shoe. I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!"}

But when I worked out high impact, my toes tingled, went numb and cramped because the toe bed is very narrow. Also, there wasn't enough cushion for me. When doing lunges, the ball of my feet hurt. Can't return them because I wore them several times. These might be fine for someone with a narrow foot."}

No other shoe can compare to how the individual nubs on the bottom allow your foot to be cushioned, yet work like it's suppose to. My feet feel cradled in this shoe and hard surfaces don't make my feet ache anymore.\n\nThese shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).\n\nHighly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks.

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers.

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all."}
